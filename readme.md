# Personal Finance WebApp

## Overview

I organize my personal finance in spread sheets since 2001. I have been tested a lot of public web and mobile app alternatives but in the end I still remain making it by my own way.

This project goal is to create a small web app to deal with my personal workflow, but also to improve my software engineering skills and give me the opportunity to experience, study and test some core concepts I don't use - or at least don't know I have to - in my daily Data Engineering and Analyst jobs.

I also used it to test some python libraries, technologies and their interactions, like: Streamlit, SQLModel and FastAPI.

There are only two ways to interact with it: Importing account or credit-card statements and, then, classifing the entries that are generated throught this process.
